# Sublime_buildFiles
Sublime build files I use for Sublime Text 3 and Windows 10. Mac users....I can't help ya, Linux users....already know how to use build files.
These build files may need to be modified if used on earlier versions of Windows.
Install Sublime build files in C:\Users\\<userAccountName>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User
You can install build files up one directory but these files can be overwritten during updates.
I am curious to what others are using for different build files and I will be adding more periodically.
